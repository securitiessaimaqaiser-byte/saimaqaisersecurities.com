    <h2>General Risk Factors</h2>
    <ul>

        economic developments, political events, and other factors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Past performance of securities or financial instruments does not
        guarantee future results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investments may result in partial or total loss of capital.

    <h2>Market Risk</h2>
    <p>
      Market risk refers to the possibility of losses due to changes in

      volatility and liquidity constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>Liquidity Risk</h2>
    <p>
      Some securities may not be readily tradable in the market due to
      low trading volumes. This may affect the ability to buy or sell
      securities at desired prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Operational & System Risks</h2>
    <p>
      Trading systems, communication networks, and electronic platforms

        securities transactions before investing.

        Clients should seek independent financial, legal, or tax advice
        if required.
