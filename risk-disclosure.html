      interest rate changes, and market sentiment. There is no guarantee of profit.
    </p>

    <h2>Liquidity Risk</h2>

      Certain securities may not be readily tradable due to low market liquidity.

      There is a risk that counterparties may fail to meet their financial obligations.

      Changes in laws, regulations, or policies by regulatory authorities such as SECP
      or PSX may impact market operations, trading conditions, or investor rights.
    </p>

    <h2>Past Performance</h2>
    <p>
      Past performance of securities or investment strategies does not guarantee future
      results. Historical data should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.
